A list of problems I have solved on CodeWars.com with their solutions

Each problem will be structured as follows:

Poblem Title (Problem Difficulty)  
Problem Description  
Solution (some may include commentary on new things I learned while solving that particular problem)  
Problem Link (Credit)  

Many of these problems I revisit as my skill progresses, but previous solutions will not be overwritten. Every solution you see is my own, and is not assisted by AI or other solutions.
I've included a list of problems that I felt upon completion gave me a sense of accomplishment, or were fun enough for me that I wanted to include them.
